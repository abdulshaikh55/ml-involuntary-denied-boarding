# Involuntary Denied Boarding
Although I have made a few machine learning models before, this one is different as I am using the the good ol' trial-and-error. 

This learning technique will help you, as a programmer, get a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts. And, as your accuracy percentage gets higher and higher with each trial, the error part will be more tolerable.

This model started off at 28%, now it is at 46%.

What changes I made to the project are given in the [word document](./denied_onboarding.docx). I'll be adding more steps.
